This is a programming project that I made as a personal project for fun. :) 

The project is called "Faith's Adventure" 
The plot being that you're a young girl who's dog has been stolen by an Evil Witch. It runs solely on the console and doesn't have GUI. 

This project was written completely in Java, and included working with objects, and file systems.
